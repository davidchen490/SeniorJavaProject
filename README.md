# SeniorJavaProject

Java Design Project by Wayne Valley High School AP Computer Science and Honors Java Students

# Objective

Create a full functioning Java game using only default Java libraries and user-created classes

# Restrictions

Each group only had 28 days to complete this assignment. Each group had one or two Honors Java mentors and four to five AP Computer Science students. Each group was assigned $500 "Grasso Bucks" which were used for resources used in the project (i.e. a picture costs 10 Grasso Bucks).

# How to Run Game

Download the repository as a .ZIP file and double click the Toby.jar and run as a Java Application.

Alternatively, advanced users can compile and run the source files.
